# bee-game
This is a bee game using javascript only, no libraries

Gameplay: 
You are Team Bee. 
Move through squares until you get near one of the wasps, then attack by clicking the enemy's square. This will randomly decrease its health. When it turns to 0, the wasp dies and you are able to claim, optionally, its spot.
Your health might also decrease randomly while attacking.
The final goal is to erase all wasps, including the Queen Wasp.
